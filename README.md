"# Diary" 
"# This project is a Basic project for User Diary in Python" 

This App has been Dockerized now , but I do not have any docker repository , so putting this code in git hub . Any suggessions on this app are most welcome.

One just need to run `docker-compose up -d` in order to run this application . One can access the app in `http://localhost:5000/` link and the mongodb will run in `27017` port .

#Note: Docker should have installed as a prerequisite. 

Thank you,
