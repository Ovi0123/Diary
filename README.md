"# Diary" 
"# This project is a Basic project for User Diary in Python" 

This App has been Dockerized now , but I do not have any docker repository my myself . So , I am just putting this code in github so that many can only fork this application and run their code . If any new changes they want to do , then they can also do it freely or any bug fix is required we will do it or you may . Suggessions also welcome .

One just need to run `docker-compose up -d` in order to run this application . One can access the app in `http://localhost:5000/` link and the mongodb will run in `27017` port .

Thank you,
